## Lnch 
*A shell utility that executes a Launchfile  
Useful for when the app needs an terminal in the background, 
as well as when you don't want to add a directory with a binary to a path*

### Versions
version0 directory contains a very early version of the program  
It has no Launchfile creation, is very manual (no installation script, so add to path or alias/function in bashrc),
and I do not plan to maintain it

version1 is planned to be a complete rewrite of the original script  
As of right now(15/05/2020) it does not exist yet, but I am in the process of writing it
